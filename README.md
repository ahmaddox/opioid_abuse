2. Determine the relationship between poverty levels and opioid abuse
3. Determine the relationship between dependence / abuse on illicit drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and opioid abuse
4. Determine the relationship between pain prescription use and pain prescription misuse
5. Classify opioid abuse using ensemble method machine learning to determine whether or not a person would be an opioid user or not

## Description of Dataset

The dataset, 2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, has been retrieved from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Adminstration website. The survey is sponsored by the Center for Behavorial Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ). 

The NSDUH Code Book defines the target population for the survey as not having changed since 1991, and includes "civilian, noninstitutionalized population of the United States (including civilians living on military bases) who were 12 years of age or older at the time of the survey." The Code Book describes the specific method for choosing sample sizes by state, which includes oversampling for larger metropolitan areas.

**The data includes 56,313 observations and 2,691 columns of data.**
